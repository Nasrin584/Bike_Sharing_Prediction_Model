# Bike_Sharing_Prediction_Model
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 
### **Problem Statement**
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, has experienced a significant revenue decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and sustain itself in the competitive market, the company is developing a strategic business plan to anticipate post-pandemic demand for shared bikes.

To achieve this, BoomBikes has partnered with a consulting firm to analyze the key factors influencing bike demand in the American market. They aim to identify significant variables that predict bike usage and understand their impact.

Using extensive data on daily bike demand, influenced by meteorological conditions and consumer behavior, BoomBikes seeks to position itself effectively once economic conditions stabilize. By leveraging these insights, the company aims to enhance its services, differentiate itself from competitors, and drive profitability in the post-lockdown period.
### **Business Goal**
The objective is to develop a predictive model for shared bike demand, identifying key factors influencing usage patterns. By analyzing how demand fluctuates with different variables, the company can refine its business strategy to optimize supply, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize profitability. The model will provide data-driven insights to help management make informed decisions, ensuring efficient resource allocation. Additionally, it will serve as a valuable tool for understanding demand dynamics in new markets, enabling BoomBikes to expand strategically and maintain a competitive edge in the bike-sharing industry.
